## Overview

Psych-Reasoner is an innovative AI training paradigm inspired by the "Absolute Zero Reasoner" methodology. It aims to create highly introspective, psychologically intelligent mental health agents through sophisticated self-play and multi-agent learning techniques.

### Why Psych-Reasoner?
Traditional mental health chatbots often struggle with:
- Complex psychological resistance and trauma
- Cultural and personality diversity
- Deep introspective guidance
- Adaptive therapeutic responses

Our solution addresses these limitations through an autonomous self-play training environment that simulates complex, evolving psychological dynamics.

## Key Features

- ðŸ¤– **Multi-Agent Ecosystem**: Simulated psychological personas with diverse backgrounds
- ðŸ§  **Advanced Learning**: Reinforcement learning with adversarial and cooperative training
- ðŸŽ¯ **Therapeutic Approaches**: Integration of CBT, introspection, and shadow work
- ðŸ“ˆ **Measurable Outcomes**: Verifiable emotional progress tracking
- ðŸ”„ **Adaptive Responses**: Dynamic adjustment to various psychological scenarios

## System Architecture

### 1. Synthetic Agent Community
- Diverse mental health case simulations
- Comprehensive personality modeling
- Variable factors:
  - Cultural background
